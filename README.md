# Generative Adversarial Networks for Anomaly Detection in ICS

This project focuses on the application and potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for multivariate anomaly detection in time series data, specifically in the field of Industrial Control Systems (ICS).

## Introduction

Anomaly detection plays a critical role in identifying abnormal patterns or behaviors that deviate from expected norms. In ICS, anomalies can have severe consequences, such as equipment failure, safety hazards, or security breaches. Traditional anomaly detection methods may struggle to capture complex and dynamic anomalies in time series data.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have gained significant attention in the field of deep learning for their ability to generate realistic data samples. However, GANs can also be used for anomaly detection by leveraging their generative capabilities to learn the underlying distribution of normal data and identify deviations from it.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are as follows:

- Research: Conduct in-depth research on the application of GANs for multivariate anomaly detection in time series data, with a focus on ICS.

- Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the GAN-based anomaly detection model using appropriate metrics and benchmark datasets. Compare the results with traditional anomaly detection methods to assess the effectiveness and advantages of GANs in ICS anomaly detection.

- Documentation: Provide clear documentation on the implementation details, experimental setup, and results obtained. Explain the steps to use and deploy the developed model effectively.
